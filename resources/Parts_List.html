<h1 id="hardware-for-me405-preliminary-list">Hardware for ME405: Preliminary List</h1>
<p>It is possible that due to the ongoing pandemic, ME405 may have to shift from in-person to online instruction. The course is being designed to facilitate such a shift should it become necessary. We’re stockpiling as many components for checkout as we can, but if the shift happens, you’ll need tools and components with which to work. Having some of these items will be helpful even if we don’t have to work remotely.</p>
<p>The following list contains some recommended hardware for ME405. You are not required to buy the specific components listed, and your instructor is <code>#not_sponsored</code> by any of the vendors; other compatible tools and components are fine, and reusing equipment from a previous course is encouraged.</p>
<p><span style="color:red">Parts marked in red are strongly recommended for students who will not be able to attend the first week or two due to COVID isolation.</span></p>
<p>Be wary of very cheap components which ship from overseas, as shipping times are unpredictable in the best of times and even more problematic now. Due dates cannot be extended due to AliBaba™ issues. Also, the quality control of the cheaper products tends to be poor, and you may wind up with components which don’t work.</p>
<p>If you are facing a substantial financial hardship, please let us know and we will work to find ways to make as many of the items below as possible available to you during the quarter at minimal or no cost.</p>
<p><em>There are many links to one particular company below. This is not an endorsement of that particular company; it’s just an easy way to show, and to see, examples of the items recommended. If you can find a better deal elsewhere, or if you prefer to shop at other companies because monopolies stink and/or you consider the founder a doofus, you have our support in doing so.</em></p>
<h2 id="measurement-tools">Measurement Tools</h2>
<p>Everyone should purchase at least a multimeter and cheap logic analyzer; you’ll use these in this course, other courses, your career, and probably around the house for many years.</p>
<h3 id="digital-multimeter">Digital Multimeter</h3>
<p><span style="color:red">Week 1 Remote Recommended</span><br />
A cheap multimeter is sufficient for ME405. Even an old analog multimeter is sufficient as long as it has high input impedance (≥10MΩ).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/AstroAI-Digital-Multimeter-Voltage-Tester/dp/B01ISAMUA6" class="uri">https://www.amazon.com/AstroAI-Digital-Multimeter-Voltage-Tester/dp/B01ISAMUA6</a><br />
<a href="https://www.harborfreight.com/7-Function-Digital-Multimeter-63759.html" class="uri">https://www.harborfreight.com/7-Function-Digital-Multimeter-63759.html</a></p>
<h3 id="logic-analyzer-andor-scope">Logic Analyzer and/or ’Scope</h3>
<p><span style="color:red">Week 1 Remote Recommended</span><br />
An inexpensive USB logic analyzer is very helpful for diagnosing problems with digital communication channels, PWM signals, and other digital signals. There are dozens of brand names for sub-$20 analyzers, and nearly all seem to be essentially identical.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/KeeYees-Analyzer-Device-Channel-Arduino/dp/B07K6HXDH1/" class="uri">https://www.amazon.com/KeeYees-Analyzer-Device-Channel-Arduino/dp/B07K6HXDH1/</a></p>
<p><em><strong>Windows<sup>TM</sup> Note:</strong> Installing the drivers on this OS can be a pain, though it’s worth it to have the analyzer working. If your system won’t detect the analyzer and you have a Bluetooth mouse, try unplugging the mouse adapter (substitute a USB mouse with a cord) while you install the drivers for the logic analyzer.</em></p>
<p>If you’re not in financial difficulty, you might consider a USB oscilloscope with logic analyzer such as the following:</p>

<h3 id="breadboard">Breadboard</h3>
<p><span style="color:red">Week 1 Remote Recommended</span><br />
Any small solderless breadboard with at least 400 contact points should be fine. An example which comes in a set with convenient color-coded wires <em>(the use of color coded wires is <strong>highly</strong> recommended)</em> is shown below.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breadboard-Solderless-Prototype-Male-Female-Female-Female/dp/B077XK8V4G" class="uri">https://www.amazon.com/Breadboard-Solderless-Prototype-Male-Female-Female-Female/dp/B077XK8V4G</a></p>
<h3 id="motor-power-supply">Motor Power Supply</h3>
<p>The microcontroller board can be powered through its USB connector, but motors need a separate power supply. A generic “wall wart” is usually fine as long as it can produce at least two amps or so at the desired voltage. To use the very cheap driver board below, you need a <strong>9 volt</strong> power supply. A supply which comes with an adapter for its plug is extra helpful. Examples:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Charger-Switching-Adapter-Speakers-Transformer/dp/B08SKY1P8G/" class="uri">https://www.amazon.com/Charger-Switching-Adapter-Speakers-Transformer/dp/B08SKY1P8G/</a><br />

<h3 id="microcontroller-on-a-board">Microcontroller on a board</h3>
<p>We’re trying to scrape up enough Nucleo circuit boards and Shoes of Brian to enable one to be checked out to each student. However, as boards are sometimes damaged during class (Burn by Doing) and we don’t have a lot of spares, it may be necessary to find more or make substitutions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>STM32L476RG Nucleo. These boards are currently out of stock at major distributors such as Mouser and Digi-Key, but occasionally a few show up. Ordering directly from ST may be an option.</p>
One can use some other Nucleos, but they don’t have as much flash storage space as the STM32L476RG, which causes problems when you need to use several program files. Boards which can be used in a limited way include the following:
<ul>
<li>STM32F401RE Nucleo</li>
<li>STM32F411RE Nucleo</li>
<li>STM32F446RE Nucleo</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:<br />
<a href="https://www.mouser.com/" class="uri">https://www.mouser.com/</a> and search for “Nucleo STM32L476”<br />
<a href="https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/stmicroelectronics/NUCLEO-L476RG/497-15881-ND/5347711" class="uri">https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/stmicroelectronics/NUCLEO-L476RG/497-15881-ND/5347711</a></p></li>
<li><p>ESP32 prototyping boards may be used for term projects with some additional work to port the software from one processor type to another. ESP32s have WiFi and Bluetooth radios built in. However, the ESP32’s peripherals such as A/D converter, PWM, and counter/timers aren’t as good (in the lab instructor’s opinion) as those of the STM32, and they don’t work with the Shoe of Brian, so you have to set up a different way to connect sensors and motor drivers. AdaFruit Feathers are more expensive and have fewer pins than some other boards but include a built-in LiPo battery management system that allows convenient charging and wireless use.</p>
<p>Examples: (<span style="color:red">Week 1 Remote Recommended</span> unless you will be isolating in San Luis Obispo, in which case we may be able to arrange an outdoor, isolated pickup of a ME405 kit with Nucleo and Shoe)</p>

<!--## Motor Driver Board
  A simple motor driver board will be used for prototyping and testing your software.
  The motor driver which you design onto your custom circuit board may or may not be
  identical, but it will most likely operate in the same way.  There are hundreds if
  not dozens of small motor driver boards available.  The first one listed below is
  very inexpensive but needs a 9 volt (not 12 volt) power supply:
  
  <https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/pololu-corporation/2990/2183-2990-ND/10450471>-->
<h3 id="small-dc-motor">Small DC motor</h3>
<p>You’ll need a small DC motor with some sort of position encoder. It is recommended to <strong>wait</strong> until the <strong>term project is defined</strong> before choosing a geared motor, as the gear ratio will need to be specified as part of your design.</p>
<p><em>Note that a motor’s voltage rating is the maximum voltage at which it is designed to run without damage. You do <strong>not</strong> need to run the motor at exactly that voltage, so for example, a 12V motor can be run from a 9V supply; it won’t produce as much torque, but it will run. You should ensure that the supply voltage is more than half the rated voltage, though, to ensure that the motor isn’t so weak as to hardly move.</em></p>

<!--## Accelerometer or IMU on a Breakout Board
  You'll need one of these sensors to complete one of our labs. An old IMU from ME405 
  should be fine, or perhaps one of the following:
  
  <https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-MPU-6050-Accelerometer-Gyroscope-Converter/dp/B01DK83ZYQ>
  
  <https://www.amazon.com/MMA8452Q-Module-Sensors-Accelerometer-Communication/dp/B07VNZXJ6L>
  
  Just the accelerometer should be OK for lab exercises, but depending on your term
  project, the IMU (the MPU-6050 above) might be a better choice, as it incorporates
  a 3-axis accelerometer _and_ a 3-axis angular rate sensor.  -->
<h2 id="assembly-tools">Assembly Tools</h2>
<h3 id="soldering-iron">Soldering Iron</h3>
<p>We have good soldering stations in the lab, but lab access may be restricted. It is recommended that if you choose to solder, you have soldering gear of your own or at least available to you at your home (but never anywhere near food).</p>
<p>The following irons are some of the least expensive whose quality and safety are reasonably acceptable. There are similar looking imitations for about the same price whose quality is unknown to us. You’ll probably also need some extra tips if you do much soldering; some people prefer the pointed tips linked below, while others prefer flatter “screwdriver” shaped tips (but get the small ones, not large ones which are for soldering water pipes and such). Make sure the tips you buy specifically match the model number of iron, as there are many incompatible tip styles.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Weller-WLC100-40-Watt-Soldering-Station/dp/B000AS28UC" class="uri">https://www.amazon.com/Weller-WLC100-40-Watt-Soldering-Station/dp/B000AS28UC</a><br />

<p>If you’re sure you’ll be doing a lot of mechatronic hardware work in the future, investing in a good soldering iron is recommended. We’ve had good luck with these:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hakko-FX888D-23BY-Digital-Soldering-Station/dp/B00ANZRT4M" class="uri">https://www.amazon.com/Hakko-FX888D-23BY-Digital-Soldering-Station/dp/B00ANZRT4M</a></p>
<h3 id="pliers-tweezers-and-tiny-screwdrivers">Pliers, Tweezers, and Tiny Screwdrivers:</h3>
<p>Tweezers with sharply pointed tips are very helpful for assembly of small items; most drugstores carry them. Small needle-nosed pliers and screwdrivers are helpful and available at most hardware stores. Small diagonal cutters are also an important part of one’s toolkit.</p>
